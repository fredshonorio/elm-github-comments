# elm-github-comments

An app that shows github issues as comments, for embedding on a blog.
Written in elm.

## Using it

Run `make`, which produces a `comments.js` file. You can see an example on how
to embed it on a page by looking at `app_debug.html`.

## Developing
Run `make watch` to continuously compile `comments.js`. You'll need [entr](http://entrproject.org/).
